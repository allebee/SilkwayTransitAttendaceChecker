# SilkwayTransitAttendaceChecker
This is a project I made in Hackathon 3.0 for a company called SilkwayTransit.
Using the face recognition algorithms provided by the opencv library, I made a system that records the attendance of the workers when they enter the job.
It marks the workers that are in the database by their names; those who are not in the database are marked as "None".
All the records are saved as CSV files and then converted into an excel file to be uploaded to Google Drive.
